This document describes the implementation of the stochastic mortality model as published by the Dutch Actuarial Association. Basically it shows how to generate a set of stochastic morality probabilities (qx). Based on this set you can derive
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
