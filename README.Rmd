This document describes the implementation of the stochastic mortality model as published by the Dutch Actuarial Association. Basically it shows how tkjkj o generate a set of stochastic mortality probabilities (qx). Based on these stochastic mortality probabilities all actuarial functions can be derived.
Furthermore, the package contains risk measures as VaR
---

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
